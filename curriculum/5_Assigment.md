# Final Assignment: Data acquisition with industrial manipulators

MRAC software II final assignment

## Groups

It is recommended to use the same groups as in studio.

## Assignment

In support of your studio project you will be required to acquire data from an sensor mounted on an industrial manipulator. The sensor can be any of the sensors available at IAAC. (You can use a different sensor but in this case discuss this with faculty first.)

- examples

  - Using scanning to locate irregular stock in front of the robot.
  - Using scanning to inspect the ouput of you fabrication process (e.g. 3d printing) and compare it to the expected output.
  - recording endeffector variables e.g extruder speed
  - recording robot variables e.g force, tcp position, tcp velocity, tcp acceleration
  - using a usb camera, map an overall environment until a specific tag is detected.
  - make a 3d reconstruction of an environment and compare it to the expected output.
  - make a robot follower, a robot that follows you using an apriltag.
